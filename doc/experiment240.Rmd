## Experiment 4: The Model Accuracy

I checked the sum of the variance in each cluster.
It means good model that the sum of the variance is enough to be low and that the number of given clusters with parameter is equal to that of result clusters.

I know I have to evaluate a hierarichical clustering model with [Cophenic correlation coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cophenetic_correlation).
However, the cost of the expeirment is very high in order to implement the function to calculate the coefficient. R and SciPy seems to have the way to calculating the coefficient. But it seemd to be difficult to apply my implementation result to them.
 
### Experimental Procedure

1. Generate the random data set with seed vector
2. Apply the generated data to the hierarchical clustering algorithm
3. Check the number of vectors and the variance of the each result cluster

### Sample Experiment Result

Following sample experiment result means my implementation is good.
Because the variances of each cluster is very low and the number of vectors in each cluster is equal to that  generated seed vectors.

Other experimental result are refered at Appendix B.

Where `Total Rows` means the number of the input data rows.
`Given # Clusters` means the number of clusters as one of the given parameters.
`Result # Clusters` means the number of clusters  as a result of the clustering.
`Dimension` means the number of dimensions of the input data vector.
`Train Times` means the execution time as milliseconds to train the model.
`Predict Time` means the execution time as milliseconds to predict with the data.
`Squared Mean Variance` means the squared value of the mean variance for all result clusters.

`Count` at `Result Vectors and Their Rows` means the nuber of vectors in each cluster.
`Variance` at `Result Vectors and Their Rows` means the sum of the variances for all dimension of each cluster.
`Vector` at `Result Vectors and Their Rows` means the head three element of the center of each cluster. In short, it is good that the vector is nearly equal to its seed vector.

`Count` at `Seed Vectors and Their Rows` means the number of generated vectors of each cluster.
`Seed Vector` at `Seed Vectors and Their Rows` means the head three elements of the seed vector of each cluster.
