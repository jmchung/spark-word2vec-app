## Experiment 1: Slaves x 2

### EC2 Environment

I run the hierarchical clustering application on EC2. 

- Master Instance Type: r3.large
- Slave Instance Type: r3.8xlarge
    - Cores: 32
    - Memory: 144GB
- # of Slaves: 2
    - Total Cores: 64
    - Total Memory: 239GB


### Experimental Setup

I execute my hierarchical clustering, changing the some parameters as bellow.  The data had been generated randomly. And then I measured the execution time for training each model.

- # Used Cores: 160
- # Clusters: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100
- # Rows: 100000, 10000000 10000000
- # Dimensions: 100

You know, we have to run the application under another condisions for benchmarking. For example, changing the number of used cores and the number of dimensions.

### The Result of Training Execution Time

Under the number of rows is 10000000 and the number of clusters is 100, I could not run my application, maybe because of [SPARK-3106](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-3106).

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(reshape2)
result <- read.csv("./data/benchmark-cores64-dim100.csv")
result$sec <- result$trainMilliSec / 1000
result.cast <- dcast(result, numClusters ~ rows, value.var="sec", sum)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
x <- result2.cast[, 1]
y <- result2.cast[, 2:4]
matplot(x, y
        , xlab="# Rows"
        , ylab="Training Execution Time [sec]"
        , pch=1:(length(y)), col=rainbow(length(y)), type="o")
grid()
legend("topleft", legend=c(names(y))
       , pch=1:(length(y)), col=rainbow(length(y)))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="asis"}
kable(result)
```

Where `numClusters` is the number of clusters gotten, `trainMilliSec` is the execution time for training in millisecond, `dimension` is the number of dimensions of the vectors which are treated in the clustering algorithm, `rows` is the number of trained vectors, `numPartitions` is the number of partitions of a RDD, `sec` is the execution time for training in second.
